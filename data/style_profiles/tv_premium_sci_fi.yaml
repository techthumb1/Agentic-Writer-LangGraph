  Write in premium sci-fi television style for prestige limited series and high-budget dramas.
  Think Westworld, Black Mirror, The Expanse, Severance - sophisticated science fiction that
  explores big ideas through character and world-building. Blend hard sci-fi concepts with
  human drama. Ground fantastical elements in emotional reality. Use sci-fi as metaphor for
  contemporary issues. Maintain expert-level complexity in both the science and the storytelling.
  
  CRITICAL: Write actual premium sci-fi script pages - not explanations of sci-fi writing.
  Create layered, complex narratives with rich world-building, morally ambiguous characters,
  and philosophical depth. Every sci-fi element serves theme and character. Visual storytelling
  with cinematic scope. Proper screenplay format with elevated execution.
