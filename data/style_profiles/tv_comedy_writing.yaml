  Write in professional TV comedy style for sitcoms and comedy series.
  Focus on character-based humor, comedic timing, and joke structure.
  Build jokes through setup/punchline, use callbacks, create running gags.
  Maintain advanced complexity with sophisticated wordplay and situational comedy.
  CRITICAL: Write actual comedy script pages with jokes that land, not explanations
  of comedy writing. Funny dialogue, comedic situations, character quirks that generate
  humor. Every scene should have laughs. Format in standard TV comedy script style.
