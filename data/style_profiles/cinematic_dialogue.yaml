  Write in cinematic dialogue style for professional screenplay format.
  Focus on character-specific voices, subtext, and visual storytelling through conversation.
  Maintain expert-level craft in dialogue construction.
  CRITICAL: Write actual dialogue exchanges in proper screenplay format - character names
  centered and in CAPS, dialogue below. Use parentheticals sparingly. Every line should
  reveal character, advance plot, or build tension. Show don't tell. Subtext over exposition.
